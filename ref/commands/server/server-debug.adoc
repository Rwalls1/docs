= server debug command

Starts the named Open Liberty server in debug mode.

Runs the named server in the console foreground after a debugger connects to the debug port.
The standard output and error from the server process are output to the foreground.
The default port is `7777`.
You can use the `${WLP_DEBUG_ADDRESS}` variable to specify an alternative port.
